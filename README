Program Description:
    The program reads in user input to build a tranform matrix. Once the user presses d (done)
    the program calculates the tranformed image and displays it in an OpenGL display window.
    If an output file was specified in the command line arguments, the program will write the
    image to the specified file.


Compilation:
    $> make


Use Cases:
    $> ./warper input.img [output.img]


Command Line Commands:
    Once the program is running the following command line commands will manipulate the transform the
    matrix accordingly.

    All commands accept floating point numbers except for the f command which takes integer values.

    r θ         - counter clockwise rotation about image origin, θ in degrees
    s sx sy     - scale (watch out for scale by 0!)
    t dx dy     - translate
    f xf yf     - flip - if xf = 1 flip x coordinates, yf = 1 flip y coordinates
    h hx hy     - shear
    p px py     - perspective
    d           - done


Known Bugs:
    - N/A


Additional Information:
